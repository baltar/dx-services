# DutchX Services
DutchX Services, is a project that contains services and other goodies to make
easier the interaction with the Dutch Exchange smart contracts.

# Documentation
Checkout the [DutchX Documentation](http://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

# Develop
## Run a local node and setup
Setup a working environment:
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# In one tab, run a local ganache
yarn rpc

# Run the setup script, which will:
#   - migrate all contracts into your local node
#   - create some test data, basically:
#       - I'll fund the the second account of generated with the mnemonic, so 
#         it has some funds for trading
#       - It'll add a RDN-WETH token pair into the DX
#       - It'll make sure RDN-WETH is running. It'll automatically advance time,
#         or participate in the auctions if it's required
yarn setup
```

You can make sure the auction is running:
```bash
yarn cli state RDN-WETH
```

You should see something like:
```
 INFO-cli
  INFO-cli **********  State of RDN-WETH  **********
  INFO-cli  +0ms
  INFO-cli  Token pair: RDN-WETH
  INFO-cli  +0ms

```

One interesting thing you can do is advance time:
```bash
# Advance 5.5 hours forward
yarn cli2 --time 5.5

# DEBUG-dx-service:tests:helpers:testSetup Time before increase time:  Wed, 29 Aug 2018 18:03:38 GMT +0ms
# DEBUG-dx-service:tests:helpers:testSetup Time after increase 5.5 hours:  Wed, 29 Aug 2018 18:03:38 GMT +23ms
```

If you check the state of the auction now, you'll see how the price droped. 
Also you'll see that we are 30min away from the last closing price.

There's a lot of operations you can do with the `CLI`, for some examples you
can check 
[dx-examples-cli](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-cli#basic-usage) project
. For a complete list, just type:

```bash
# Get help from the CLI
yarn cli --help

# Or, get help from a specific command from it
yarn cli buy --help
```

So for example, we can check our balance of the tokens, and our balance within
the DutchX:
```bash
# Balance for our default account
#  - 2nd one generated from the mnemonic in local (we use the 1st one for the 
#    auctioneer of the DutchX contracts)
#  - 1st ine generated from the mnemonic in any other environment
yarn cli balances

# Check the balance of any account
yarn cli balances --account 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732
```

Another example, we can post a buy order:
```bash
# Submit a postBuyOrder of 2500 RDN into WETH-RDN auction
yarn cli buy 2500 WETH-RDN

# INFO-cli Buy 2500 RDN on WETH-RDN (auction 1) using the account 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732 +0ms
# INFO-cli The buy was succesful. Transaction: undefined +253ms
```

The state now should show:
* That we bought most of the sell volume
* Now the outstanding volume is smaller. Note that in this case, the outstanding
volume is how much RDN do we need to clear the auction at the current 
price.

```

Enjoy the CLI! These are some other examples to start with:
* `yarn cli balances --account 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732`
* `yarn cli state WETH-RDN`
* `yarn cli send 0.5 WETH 0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57`
* `yarn cli deposit 0.5 WETH`
* `yarn cli deposit 150 RDN`
* `yarn cli sell 100 WETH-RDN`
* `yarn cli buy 100 RDN-WETH`

## Public API
Start API:
```bash
yarn api
```

## Liquidity Bots
Start Bots:
```bash
yarn bots
```

# Testnets or Mainnet
There's scripts for running the `cli`, `bots` and `api` for testnets and rinkeby.

You just add the network like this
```bash
# i.e. Rinkeby
yarn cli-rinkeby --help
yarn bots-rinkeby
yarn api-rinkeby
```

# Run it with docker
One easy way to run the `bots`, the `api`, the `cli` or any other script or 
utility of this proyect is using the docker image we provide:
* You can read how to run it from `dx-services`: [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md)
* A better approach would be to use the **Docker Image published on Docker Hub**
  * **Dockerhub**:
    [https://hub.docker.com/r/gnosispm/dx-services/](https://hub.docker.com/r/gnosispm/dx-services/)
  * **Example on how to run the CLI**: 
    [https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-cli](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-cli)
  * **Example on how to run the Bots**: 
    [https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-liquidity-bots](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-liquidity-bots)

# Scope and main parts of dx-services
It contains five main elements:
* **Model**: Set of convenient wrappers and utilities to provide a simpler way
  to interact with the DutchX.
    * `repositories`: Provide the data access to external data sources like
      the DutchX smart contracts, price feeds, gas price feeds, etc.
      They provide also a more intuitive error handling, that gives detailed
      information about the reasons a smart contract revert a operation.
    * `services`: Provides some common bussiness logic operations to make
      DutchX interactation easier.

* **REST Api**:
  * Exposes the DutchX data in a REST API.
  * The API methods are documented in:
    * [API and it's documentation for Rinkeby](https://dutchx-rinkeby.d.exchange/api)
    * [API and it's documentation for Mainnet](https://dutchx.d.exchange/api)
  * For an example on how to use the API, check [dx-examples-api](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-api)

* **Cli (Command Line Interface)**:
  * Allows to interact with the DutchX from the command line.
  * Allows to perform operations to retrieve the DutchX state from any Ethereum
    network
  * Also, allow to fund accounts, deposit tokens into the DutchX, participate
    in an auction as a seller or a buyer and mutch more.
  * For an example on how to use the CLI, check [dx-examples-liquidity-bots](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-liquidity-bots)

* **Liquidity Bots**
  * Allows to launch bots watching certain token pairs with the goal or ensuring
    the market liquidity.
  * The bots will automatically participate in the auctions usign the provided
    configuration.
  * For documentation about the bots, and example on how to run your own bots,
    check [dx-examples-liquidity-bots](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-liquidity-bots)

* **Scheduled tasks**:
  * Allow to execute certain tasks at certain times.
  * **Used for Reporting**: Allows to send reports periodically with the
    informarmition of the lasts auctions and the actions the bots has been taking.
  * **Used for Autoclaiming**: Allows the bots to claim their funds of past
    auctions so they can reuse them in the upcoming ones.
